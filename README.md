# Kotlin-Playground

A pretty recent language, Kotlin has a lot of new and interesting things. While exploring the language, I thought of creating this repository to keep track of the particular features that I am learning and how I am doing that. 

I hope this repository will be of use to a lot of other people too.

Features covered till now:
- [Property Delegates][1]
- [Lambda with receivers][2]
- [Delegation in classes][3]

I plan to cover more features such as:

- Different expressions which were treated as statement in java
- Extension Properties
- Coroutines
- Object keyword

Feel free to get in touch with me for anything.
